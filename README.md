Blood-Bank_Management

•	The purpose of this study was to develop a blood management information system to assist in the management of blood donor records and ease/or control the distribution of blood in various parts of the country basing on the hospital demands. Without quick and timely access to donor records, creating market strategies for blood donation, lobbying and sensitization of blood donors becomes very difficult.

•	The blood management information system offers functionalities to quick access to donor records collected from various parts of the country. It enables monitoring of the results and performance of the blood donation activity such that relevant and measurable objectives of the organization can be checked.

•	It provides to management timely, confidential, and secure medical reports that facilitates planning and decision making and hence improved medical service delivery. 


•	The reports generated by the system give answers to most of the challenges management faces as far as blood donor records are concerned.
